# slideIntoUrDMs

A Discord bot that uses a modification of my good ol' slideshow & meme displaying
script.

`images.js` is the whole control script for managing images; I'll probably add
a bunch of conditionals to it for when I'm on a `/discord/` URL.

`default.css` is the main style css from my site.

## Why channel_id instead of names?

It's a unique id that won't have conflicts between two different servers or
channels

## Why don't you show the server and channel name as a header-ish thing on the
page?

TODO: Ya know, that's a great idea!! Maybe someday I'll find out how to convert a
channel's UUID to that.
